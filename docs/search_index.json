The first one is the mean-variance portfolio from markowitz which is simply said an optimal allocation of n asssets for a given risk or a given return. The secound problem is the index-tracking-problem which tries to construct a portfolio which has a minimal tracking error to a given benchmark. 4.1 Mean-variance portfolio (MVP) file:///C:/Users/Axel/Desktop/Master-Thesis-All/Ziel%20was%20beantwortet%20werden%20soll/Quellen%20nur%20wichtige/Grossi-Laurini2011_Article_RobustEstimationOfEfficientMea.pdf Markowitz has shown that diversifying the risk on multiple assets will reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. This result was the beginning of the widely used modern portfolio theorie which uses mathematical models to archive portfolios with minimal variance for a given return target. All these optimal portfolios for a given return target are called efficient and create the efficient frontier. 4.1.1 MVP formulation We have \\(N\\) assets and its returns on \\(T\\) diffrent days which creates a return matrix \\(R\\). Each element \\(R_{i,t}\\) contains the return of the \\(i\\)-th asset on day \\(t\\). The covariance matrix of the returns is \\(\\sum\\) and the expected returns are \\(\\mu\\). The following MVP with risk aversion parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is: https://bookdown.org/shenjian0824/portr/port-opt.html \\[ \\underset{w}{minimize} \\ \\ \\ \\lambda \\ w^T \\textstyle\\sum w - w^T\\mu \\] 4.2 Index-tracking portfolio (ITP) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
