<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> Challenges of Passiv Investing<a href="challenges-of-passiv-investing.html#challenges-of-passiv-investing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>In this Chapter we will discuss two common challenges of Passiv-Investing and create simple examples to test the PSO. The first one is the mean-variance portfolio (MVP) from the modern portfolio theory of Markowitz which is simply said an optimal allocation of assets regarding risk and return. The second challenge is the index-tracking-problem which tries to construct a portfolio which has a minimal tracking error to a given benchmark.</p>
<div id="mean-variance-portfolio-mvp" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Mean-variance portfolio (MVP)<a href="challenges-of-passiv-investing.html#mean-variance-portfolio-mvp" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Markowitz has shown that diversifying the risk on multiple assets will reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. This result was the beginning of the widely used modern portfolio theorie which uses mathematical models to archive portfolios with minimal variance for a given return target. All these optimal portfolios for a given return target are called efficient and create the efficient frontier.</p>
<div id="mvp-calculation" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> MVP calculation<a href="challenges-of-passiv-investing.html#mvp-calculation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We have <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> assets and its returns on <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> diffrent days which creates a return matrix <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Each element <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,i}\)</span> contains the return of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th asset on day <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The covariance matrix of the returns is <span class="math inline">\(\textstyle\sum\)</span> and the expected returns are <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. The MVP with risk aversion parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> like shown in <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Mar2005" role="doc-biblioref">Maringer 2005</a>)</span> minimizes the following problem:</p>
<p><code>file:///C:/Users/Axel/Desktop/Master-Thesis-All/Ziel%20was%20beantwortet%20werden%20soll/Quellen%20nur%20wichtige/Maringer2005_Book_PortfolioManagementWithHeurist.pdf</code>
<code>https://bookdown.org/shenjian0824/portr/port-opt.html</code>
<span class="math display" id="eq:MVP">\[\begin{equation}
\underset{w}{minimize} \ \ \ \lambda \ w^T \textstyle\sum w - (1-\lambda) \ w^T\mu
\tag{4.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The risk aversion parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> defines the trade-off between risk and return. <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 1\)</span> results in a minimum variance portfolio and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0\)</span> results in a maximum return portfolio. All possible <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \in [0, 1]\)</span> represent the efficient frontier.</p>

<p>We will analyse a small example to understand the meaning of the efficient frontier without going into detail how it was solved. First of all we are pulling the daily returns of 3 tickers (IBM, Google and Apple).</p>

<p>Indices are baskets of assets which are used to track the performance of a specific group of assets. For example tracks the good known Standard and Poor’s 500 index (short: S&amp;P 500) the largest 500 equitys in the United States. All indices are not investible and only serve for the visualisation of the performance of these groups of assets without transaction costs. Asset managements adopted these indices as benchmarks to compare there fund performances. Each fund has its own benchmark which contains roughly the same assets that could be purchased by the manager. If the fund under performs his benchmark, it could be a indicator for a bad decision from the fund manager. Thats why all fund managers are eager to beat there benchmarks with wisely choosen investments. The past has proven that this is rearly achived with activ managemnt after costs (quelle studie activ passiv). This is the reason why passiv managed funds with the goal to track there benchmarks are becoming more frequent. Exactly this can be archived with Index-tracking portfolios (ITP) which aim to replicate the performance of a benchmark. This can be done by either full-replication or sparse-replication. A full-replication, which produces the exact performance we aim for, isn’t possible in most cases because not all assets of a index are investable. And if so it wouldnt be wise ether because benchmarks with multiple indices can contain more than ten thousand single assets which will produce a huge amount of transaction costs. The most common way to go is a sparse replication of the performance. To do this the portfolio manager has to define his benchmark which has a great overlap with his investment universe of his fund. Afterwards he will reduce this universe by some rules of the investor, liqudity and avalability. Now he can start to optimize a portfolio, including the investors constraint, to replicate the benchmark performance. Usually, this is done by reducing the difference between the daily returns of the ITP and the benchmark:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
minimize \ \ Var(r_{p}-r_{bm})
\]</span>
First we need to substitude <span class="math inline">\(r_{p}\)</span> to get the portfolio weights <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> as follows:
<span class="math display">\[
  r_{p} = R * w
\]</span>
Afterwards we solve the Variance:
<span class="math display">\[
Var(r_{p}-r_{bm}) = Var(R * w - r_{bm}) = Var(R * w) + Var(r_{bm}) - 2 \cdot Cov(R*w,r_{bm}) = Var(R * w) + Var(r_{bm}) - 2 \cdot Var(r_{bm}) \cdot \beta^T * w
\]</span></p>
