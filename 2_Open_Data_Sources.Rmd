# Open Data Sources
To increase the reproducibility, all data is free and can be loaded with the function `getSymbols()` from the quantmod R-Package. There can be chosen between different data-sources like yahoo-finance (default), alpha-vantage, google and more. 

## R-Functions
The following functions are created to increase the simplicity of data-gathering with the quantmod R-package, that can be found in the directory named `R/` in the attached [github repository](https://github.com/AxelCode-R/Master-Thesis).

### `get_yf()`
This function is the main wrapper for gathering data with `getSymbols()` from yahoo-finance and transforms prices to returns with the `pri_to_ret` function explained in \@ref(pritoret). The output is a list that contains prices and returns as a [xts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/xts.pdf) object. The arguments that can be passed to `get_yf`, are:

+ `tickers`: Vector of symbols (asset identifiers e.g. "APPL", "GOOG", ...)
+ `from ="2020-01-01"`: R-Date
+ `to = "2021-01-01"`: R-Date
+ `price_type = "close"`: Type of prices to gather (e.g. "open", "high", "low", "close", "adjusted")
+ `return_type = "adjusted"`: Type of returns to gather (e.g. "open", "high", "low", "close", "adjusted")
+ `print = F`: Should the function print the return of `getSymbols()`

### `buffer()`
To make data reusable and decrease compiling time, this thesis saves all data gathered with `get_yf()`. It takes an R expression, evaluates it and saves it in the `buffer_data/` directory with the given name. If this name already exists it will load the R-object from the RData-file without evaluating the expression. Forcing the evaluation and overwriting the existing RData-file can be done with `force=T`.
