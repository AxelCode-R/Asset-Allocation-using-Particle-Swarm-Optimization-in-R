# Future Research
The PSO variants were analyzed and some showed promising results in solving the index tracking problem. The best of them were the local and the self-adaptive velocity variants, both of which increase the ability to find good solutions by increasing the diversity in the swarm. This often prevents premature convergence in local minimum situations. The additional advantage of the self-adaptive velocity variant is the reduction in hyperparameters, making it capable of solving a wide range of problems without additional fine-tuning effort. The implementation is identical to the source in [@FaYa2014] and works well, but it would be interesting to analyze whether it can be improved by combining it with the local variant.

The last chapter has analyzed a backtests of a practical index tracking problem for retail investors, which yielded promising results but require further evaluation to verify their stability due to path-dependent portfolios.


# Conclusion

This thesis has been concerned with analyzing and testing the PSO. The focus was on financial optimization problems in the area of quantitative portfolio management. In paxis it is relevant to solve this kind of problems with the same complexity as in real life, which is made possible by the PSO. It could be shown that even complex optimization problems can be solved in a stable way. 


It was shown in chapter \@ref(activevspassive) that more and more investors invest in passive managed funds, as they are more stable over time and have lower costs. To ensure competitiveness, it is important that quantitative strategies are automated as much as possible.  


In chapter \@ref(challenges), the typical optimization problems of quantitative investment strategies in passive investment were analyzed and visualized using examples. These include the mean variance portfolio (MVP) problem, whose solution corresponds to an optimal portfolio in terms of risk and return. Subsequently, the index tracking problem (ITP) was introduced, which aims to construct a tracking portfolio that tracks its benchmark. It has been shown that it is useful to achieve the ITP by reducing the mean square tracking error, which is defined in short by ITP-MSTE.


Afterwards, in the chapter \@ref(analyticalsolver), a quadratic optimizer called solve.QP was used to solve the quadratic problems with their constraints in the continuous case of the MVP problem and the ITP-MSTE. The `solve.QP` was further used as a benchmark to test the quality of the PSO in the subsequent chapter \@ref(spso). It turned out that the PSO needs significantly more computing time but the results are often very close to the solve.QP solution. In addition, the PSO or more precisely the standard PSO was explained in detail and illustrated with the help of visualizations and WebApps. It was also shown how the penalty method works in order to consider the constraints during optimization. Furthermore, the convergence behavior of the standard PSO was analyzed, which led to the conclusion that the standard PSO is not a local search algorithm, but can be converted into a local and also a global search algorithm through minor changes.

Since in reality a portfolio consists of integer numbers of assets, it was shown that quadratic optimizers and subsequent rounding are not sufficient for discrete problems. For the PSO, it was shown how to deal with such discrete problems and then the discrete ITP-MSTE was solved, yielding stable results. 


In the following chapter \@ref(psovariants) different variants of the PSO were analyzed and compared with the standard PSO. It was found that the local PSO and the self-adaptive velocity PSO are the best variants to solve the discrete ITP-MSTE. Since the self-adaptive velocity PSO has no hyperparameters that need to be adjusted, it was tested extensively in the following chapter. 


In the chapter \@ref(reallife) the self-adaptive velocity PSO was used to backtest a discrete ITP-MSTE. The situation of a private investor who shifts his portfolio once a month was simulated. To achieve this, a model of the ITP-MSTE was developed which takes into account the transaction costs and the maximum rebalancing per month. To solve the resulting optimization problem, the self-adaptive velocity PSO was used and restarted until no constraints were broken, which was achievable in all cases. The results indicate that the model was solved satisfactorily. Nevertheless, this model and the self-adaptive velocity PSO should be tested in more depth, as the portfolios are time-dependent, so many tests are needed to give a reliable indication of the stability.


All in all, it has been shown that PSO leads to stable results in the chosen financial optimization problems, provided that sufficient computing time is used. It is easy to formulate even complicated problems in a simple way. In the future, it will be more and more important to automate quantitative strategies in the financial sector, which is why it can be assumed that optimization methods such as PSO will be used more and more frequently.
