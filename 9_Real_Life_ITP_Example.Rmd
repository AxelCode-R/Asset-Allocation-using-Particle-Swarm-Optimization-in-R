The previous chapters have analyzed the capability's of a PSO and the quality of the results by solving a problem in a single timepoint. In practice, the stability of future results on multiple timepoints is of higher interest. Therefore the next sections provide additional constraints that are needed to simulate real portfolios over multiple rebalancing dates, starting by adding transaction costs to the problem. The first reblancing date will define a problem that simulates a portfolio manager that has a defined amount of cash and tries to construct a portfolio from it, like in the last chapter. After the first iteration the portfolio manager needs to sell old assets and buy new ones. Of course do this produce additional transaction costs and effort, which is why most portfolios consider a maximal rebalancing constraint that tries to limit the amount of sold and bought assets. This procedure is called a backtest, which tries to simulate the performance of a portfolio dependent on the previous portfolio and all historic data on each rebalancing date.

Afterwards the forecast ability and stability of the objectives is analyzed by solving a ITP 




This chapter is more praxis related and focuses on simulating the generated portfolios into the future with multiple rebalancing points.
