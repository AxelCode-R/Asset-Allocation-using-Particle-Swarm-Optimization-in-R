# Analytical Solver for Quadratic Problems
The benefits and drawbacks of analytical solvers for quadratic problems will be discussed in this chapter after chapter 5's discussion of some common problems and their solutions. Because it would go beyond the scope of this thesis to explain the mathematical underlying principles of how a solver addresses quadratic problems, only the application and analysis are discussed here.

## Quadratic Programs (QP)
A quadratic program is specifically a minimization problem of some function that returns a scalar and consists of an quadratic term and an linear term dependent on the variable of interest. Additionally can the problem be constrained by some linear inequalities. The formal formulation is to find $x$ that minimizes the following problem:
$$
  min \ \frac{1}{2} \cdot x^T \times D \times x - d^T \times x 
$$
and holds under the following linear constraints:
$$
  A^T \times x >= b_0
$$
with a symmetric positive definite matrix $D$. \\

Some other sources notate the problems with different signs or coefficients that are all exchangeable with the above stated problem. Additionally has the problem above the same notation that is used in the R-Package `quadprog` which will reduce substitution efforts. All modern programming languages do have many solvers for quadratic problem. They differ mostly on the computational time on different problems and the requirements to use it. Some commercial QP-solvers do additionally accept more complex constraints like absolute (e.g. $|A^T \times x| >= a_0$) or mixed-integer (e.g. $x \in \mathbb{N}$). But specially the mixed-integer constraint will result in a enormously increase of memory.
