# Activ vs Passiv Portfolio Managment
An active portfolio manager seeks to achieve positive alpha, i.e., excess returns relative to the market, by applying its knowledge, experience, and in-depth analysis of individual assets. Therefore, the manager assumes that the market is not efficient and tries to select mispriced assets to generate excess returns. The passive portfolio manager, on the other hand, assumes that the market is efficient, that is, that prices reflect all available information, and attempts to replicate the average market return by building a diversified portfolio. He knows that stock movements follow a "random walk" and are therefore unpredictable for any individual stock. The passive manager achieves his goal with a quantitative strategy and assumes that the results will be stable over time. 

The question is which of the two types of portfolio management is preferable.

Researchers Fama and French studied the returns of active and passive portfolio management by designing factor models that led to a wide range of models commonly used today to analyze the causes of returns. Their theory states that passive investors earn passive returns that have an alpha of zero before costs. This implies that active investors also collectively have an alpha of zero before costs. This means that if some active investors have a positive alpha, other active investors have achieved a negative alpha. Indeed, Fama and French analyzed this behavior in more detail in [@FaFr2010], finding that value-weighted professionally managed mutual funds that invest primarily in the U.S. equity market have a slightly positive alpha before costs at the expense of active investors outside of professionally managed mutual funds.

Fama and French attempted to distinguish between luck and chance using regression models. Their results suggest that some active managers in the top percentiles have sufficient skill to cover costs over the long run. Nonetheless, aggregate actively managed funds in the top percentiles have estimated alpha after costs close to zero, which is also true for large, efficiently managed passive funds.

Similar results were obtained in [@PaHi2016], which analyzed European and U.S. active and passive funds. The results show that none of them is superior by cost. They suggest comparing actively and passively managed funds on a case-by-case basis by considering all expenses. When the tax advantages of passively managed funds are taken into account, they may have a slight advantage for investors with a long investment horizon.
