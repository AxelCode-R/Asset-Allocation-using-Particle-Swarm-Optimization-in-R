# Activ vs Passiv Portfolio Managment
An active portfolio manager seeks to achieve positive alpha, i.e., excess return relative to the market, by using his knowledge, experience, and in-depth analysis of individual assets. Therefore, the manager assumes that the market is not efficient and tries to select mispriced assets to achieve excess returns. The passive portfolio manager, on the other hand, assumes that the market is efficient, meaning that prices reflect all available information, and attempts to replicate the average market return by constructing a diversified portfolio. He knows that stock movements follow a "random walk" and are therefore unpredictable for any individual stock. The passive manager achieves his goal with a quantitative strategy and assumes that the results are stable over time. 

The question arises which of the two portfolio management types is preferable?

The scientists Fama and French analysed the returns of active and passive portfolio management by utilizing factor models which resulted in a wide range of now commonly used models to analyse the origin of returns. There theory is that passive investors get passive returns that have a alpha of zero before costs. This implicitly says that active investors combined have a alpha of zero before costs too. This means that if some active investors have a positive alpha, other active investors have made a negative alpha. In fact Fama and French analyzed this behavior more deeply in [@FaFr2010] which indicated that value weighted professionally managed investment funds that primarily invest in the U.S. stock market have a slightly positive alpha in expense of active investors outside the professionally managed investment funds.
