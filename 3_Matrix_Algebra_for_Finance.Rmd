# Matrix Algebra
This chapter is a summary of the mathematical calculations and conventions used in this Thesis. Its importent to note that all mathematical formulars are notated in a matrix notation. Most of the time this will result in a direct translation into R-code.

```{r, include=F}
source("global.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = T, warning=F, message=F)
```

## Basic Operators
The following table is a little compendium which will compare the used mathimatical symbols to R-code and its meanings:
```{r, echo=F}
reactable(
  data.frame(
    "Latex" = c("&#215;", 'A<sup>T</sup>'),
    "R"= c("%*%", "t(A)"),
    "Meaning" = c("Matrix or vector multiplication", "transpose of Matrix or vector")
  ), 
  columns <- list(
    Latex = colDef(name = "Latex/Displayed", html = T),
    R = colDef(name="R-Code")
  ),
  style = list(fontFamily="arial", fontSize=13)
) %>% 
  html_save()
```
